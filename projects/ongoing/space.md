title: 'Mechanisms of Space Representation. Predictive Processing Approach'
---

The goal of the project is to analyse the mechanisms of egocentric space perception and representation in order to offer a model of the underlying neural mechanisms, and to account for the dynamics of interaction between the egocentric and allocentric frame of reference.

The project takes an interdisciplinary perspective towards the problem, using tools from cognitive science, most significantly computational modeling, and from philosophy of mind. A dominant part in the project's methodology plays the predictive processing framework, both from the modeling and theoretical perspective.

The project stems from the Skill Theory v2.0 proposed by Rick Grush and further develops these ideas, in order to fully account for all aspects of cognitive abilities of space perception and representation, and to connect Grush's ideas with state-of-the-art approaches to the modeling of cognition.

A strong focus of the project is also on the phenomenological states associated with perception of spatial properties, what Grush called _spatial purport of perceptual experience_.

The project is supervised by Paweł Gładziejewski, Ph.D. (Nicolas Copernicus University) and financed by Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education (2019-2023, under the “Diamond grant” program, total funding 180,000PLN/~46,000$, grant number: DI2018 010448) to the University of Warsaw.
