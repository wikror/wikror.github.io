This paper ([available here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13164-021-00533-w)) has been a journey---rejected two times since the first draft and two years in the making, it has grown into something different than we initially planned with [Krzysiek](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pSiBarMAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1&oi=ao), when I sent him the [Chalmers' meta-problem paper](https://philarchive.org/archive/CHATMO-32) and he asked if we want to write a comment together, but it turned out much more exciting!

In the current version we begin by pointing out that the meta-problem approach laid out by Chalmers is significantly flawed, as any solution it may arrive at depends on the assumptions about what intuitions are. Then we advance a novel and alternative program of investigating folk views on phenomenal consciousness, centering their positive intuitions. Instead of asking what consciousness _is not_, as Chalmers proposes---which could at best verify some of the extant approaches---we propose to ask what consciousness _is_ (or _how_ consciousness is). In this way, we believe, experimental philosophy could help generating new alternatives to entrenched views in consciousness debates.
