I'm a PhD student at the Interdisciplinary Doctoral School, University of Warsaw. I'm working at the [Human Interactivity and Language Lab](https://hill.psych.uw.edu.pl){:target="_blank"} with my prof. [Joanna Rączaszek-Leonardi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OPggSAYAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}. My second supervisor is prof. [Marcin Miłkowski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2UfI6q8AAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"} from the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

I'm interested predominantly in  & life from the 4E perspective, with a special focus on the predictive processing (aka active inference, aka free energy principle) framework and on the issue of ties between biology and mind (which, I believe, are quite tight). My AOIs include philosophy of cognitive science, philosophy of biology, philosophy of science in practice, digital philosophy of science, dynamical systems theory.

My doctoral work is concerned with the widespread use of the term ["communication" in life sciences](./projects/communication), it is partially funded by the Preludium grant from National Science Center (2023-2026, total funding ~41,000$).

I'm also finishing a project aiming at [modeling (egocentric) space perception & representation](./projects/space), supervised by [Paweł Gładziejewski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ql2ajksAAAAJ&hl=pl){:target="_blank"}, PhD (Nicolas Copernicus University) and financed by Polish Ministry of Education and Science (2019-2023, under the "Diamond grant" program, total funding 180,000PLN/~46,000$).
