I'm a PhD student at the Interdisciplinary Doctoral School, University of Warsaw. 

I work primarily at the intersection of philosophy of cognitive science and philosophy of biology, using methods of digital humanities and natural language processing to study concept use in scientific articles.

My doctoral work is concerned with the widespread use of the term ["communication" in life sciences](./projects/communication). I analyze a corpus of over 1.1 million articles across biology and cognitive science to highlight recurring conceptual patterns. This work is partially funded by the Preludium grant from National Science Center. 

I'm based at the [Human Interactivity and Language Lab](https://hill.psych.uw.edu.pl){:target="_blank"} with my supervisor, prof. [Joanna Rączaszek-Leonardi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OPggSAYAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}. I'm also working at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology with my second supervisor, prof. [Marcin Miłkowski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2UfI6q8AAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"} from the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

I'm interested predominantly in cognition & life from the 4E perspective, with a special focus on understanding the connections between biology and mind, and the practices of scientific research in life and cognitive sciences, especially in the field of basal cognition. My AOIs include philosophy of cognitive science, philosophy of biology, philosophy of science in practice, digital philosophy of science, dynamical systems theory.

I'm also a member of the organizing team for the [School of Ideas in Neuroscience](https://nenckiopenlab.org/the-school-of-ideas-in-neuroscience/), a unique summer school that aims to explore the role of theory in neuroscientific research.

Previously I've worked on a project aiming at [modeling (egocentric) space perception & representation](./projects/space), supervised by [Paweł Gładziejewski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ql2ajksAAAAJ&hl=pl){:target="_blank"}, PhD (Nicolas Copernicus University) and financed by Polish Ministry of Education and Science.
