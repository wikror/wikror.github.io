<!-- # Wiktor Rorot -->
<!--
I am an aspiring philosopher, currently studying at the University of Warsaw. This website collects some info [about me](./about) and the [projects](./projects) I'm working on.

I also have a blog here, but I don't suspect I will be using it often. -->

I'm a PhD student at the Interdisciplinary Doctoral School, University of Warsaw. I'm working at the [Human Interactivity and Language Lab](https://hill.psych.uw.edu.pl){:target="_blank"} with my supervisor, prof. [Joanna Rączaszek-Leonardi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joanna_Rczaszek-Leonardi2){:target="_blank"}.

I'm interested predominantly in mind & cognition from the 4E perspective, with a special focus on the predictive processing (aka active inference, aka free energy principle) framework and on the issue of emergence and evolution of life and mind. My AOIs include philosophy of cognitive science, philosophy of biology, philosophy of science in general, consciousness studies, dynamical systems theory, information theory.

My doctoral project is concerned with the widespread use of the term ["communication" in life sciences](./projects/communication).

I'm also heading a project aiming at [modeling (egocentric) space perception & representation](./projects/space), supervised by [Paweł Gładziejewski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ql2ajksAAAAJ&hl=pl){:target="_blank"}, PhD (Nicolas Copernicus University) and financed by Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education (2019-2023, under the "Diamond grant" program, total funding 180,000PLN/~46,000$).
